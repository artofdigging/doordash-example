1. How might you test this component?
   > One way to test it is by using visual regrestion tests. You can set up a CD/CI pipeline that could run and display any differences when the compoents are updated. Another way would be to manually run test cases.
2. A quick note on how you might assist others in adopting/using the component in their code?
   > First I would show them what I implmented and get their feed back. Once that has happened, I would try and add it to their code, and then make adjustments based on their feedback
